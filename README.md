# brigdrake-demo

This is a dedicated repository for demonstrating brigdrake. Its existence means
we don't have to pollute other [lovethedrake](https://github.com/lovethedrake)
repositories with nonsense PRs.

Since most (but not all) PRs opened against this repository are for the sake of
demonstration only, most will never be merged.
